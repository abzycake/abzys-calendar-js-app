## How to Use

1. Open `https://github.com/abzycake/abzys-calendar-js-app` in a web browser.
2. Edit timeblocks to add events and other reminders for the day.
3. Save reminders, which will remain even after refreshing and leaving the page.
   - Stores events in local storage
   - Colour-codes the past, present and future timeblocks for ease of use
   - Displays the real date and uses system time for tracking events
   - Updates the blocks every 60 seconds to ensure synchronisation with current time

## File Structure

- `index.html`: HTML file providing the user interface.
- `style.css`: Basic styling for the interface.
- `scheduler.js`: JavaScript code for the main logic of the application, such as dynamic timeblock generation, colour coding blocks and stores events in local storage.
